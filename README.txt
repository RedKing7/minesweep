Minesweeper is a puzzle game made by Microsoft where the objective is to clear every space that isnâ€™t a mine. 

Built using jQuery and javaScript

Things I'd like to add: different themes
                        animations
                        permanent scoreboard
                        'cording' (command-click on a number 'n' with 'n' flags around it will reveal all other surrounding spaces)
